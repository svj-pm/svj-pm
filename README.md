# Hey, I'm Santiago V Jeyaseelan 👋

VP of Product with 15+ years in fintech, payments, and enterprise software.
I build AI-powered tools to solve real problems — not toy demos.

## What I'm Building

🔍 **AI Interview Intelligence** — An agent system that ingests company research,
job descriptions, and interviewer profiles to generate targeted preparation materials.
Built with Python + Claude API. [→ View Project](#)

🛍️ **E-Commerce Marketing Agents** — Autonomous agents handling content generation,
audience targeting, and campaign optimization for a direct-to-consumer apparel brand.
Work in progress. [→ View Project](#)


## About My Approach

I'm a product leader who builds. My background is in computer science and I spent
my early career writing Java, but I've been in product leadership for 15+ years.
I started building with AI tools in 2025 because I believe product leaders who
can't work directly with AI will be left behind.

Every project here solves a real problem I actually have. The interview agent
saved me 20+ hours of manual preparation. The marketing agents are running
campaigns for a real business. Nothing here is a tutorial project.
