# Hey, I'm Santiago

VP of Product building AI agent systems that solve real problems.

15+ years in fintech, insurtech, and enterprise software. Started my career
writing Java. Spent the last decade+ leading product teams. Now I'm building
directly with AI because I believe product leaders need to understand what
they're asking their teams to build.

## What I'm Working On

**Interview Intelligence Agent** — AI system that transforms unstructured
research into targeted preparation materials. Ingests documents, identifies
information gaps, generates role-specific outputs. Python + Claude API.

**E-Commerce Marketing Agents** — Autonomous agents for content, targeting,
and campaign optimization. Powering a real D2C apparel brand.

**Enterprise AI Prototypes** — Exploring how agent architectures can
transform enterprise document processing, policy enforcement, and
intelligent workflow routing.
(...Coming Soon)

## Why a VP of Product Has a GitHub

Most product leaders talk about AI. I build with it. Every project here
solves a real problem — the interview agent saved 20+ hours of manual work,
the marketing agents run real campaigns, and the enterprise prototypes
inform how I think about AI product strategy.
